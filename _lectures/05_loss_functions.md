**Readings:**
- [Understanding Deep Learning](https://github.com/udlbook/udlbook/releases/download/v5.0.2/UnderstandingDeepLearning_05_29_25_C.pdf), Chapter 5

**Extra Readings:**
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf), Chapters 6 and 8, especially 8.1.3
- [Maximum Likelihood Estimation Examples from an MIT course](https://youtu.be/00krscK7iBA). This video walks through MLE examples for binomial and normal distributions, but does not pull out equivalent loss functions like we did in lecture.
