title: 08 - Fitting Models
tldr: "In this lecture we look at different ways minimizing the loss function
for models given a training dataset. We'll formally define gradient descent,
then show the advantages of stochastic gradient descent and then finally see
how momentum and normalized gradients (ADAM) can improve model training farther."
