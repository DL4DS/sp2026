title: 21 - Unsupervised Learning and Variational Autoencoders
tldr: "In this lecture we revisit the concept of unsupervised learning in the
context of generative models and then dive into Variational Autoencoders. After reviewing unsupervised learning, we look look at autoencoders and their ability to reduce dimensions of
inputs into a latent space. We'll see why they don't make good generative
models and then generalize to VAEs. We'll finish with some examples of
generative output of VAEs."
